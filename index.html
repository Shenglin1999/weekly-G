    <p class="one">We learned a new skill this week. Javascript. This function is very powerful and interesting. You can use it to make our website more interesting. It can achieve many functions that html and css cannot achieve. While exploring p5.js I discovered many interesting features. It allows the website to achieve more interaction with users. I look forward to learning more interesting features in the future. </p>

    <p class="one">This week, I had very bad luck on the project. One of my ceramics works that I worked on late at night was accidentally poked in an area that was not yet dry when I was glazing it. Ruined the pattern I had worked so hard for two hours on. This makes me very frustrated. And that day was game day, so I spent a long time looking for a parking space at school before parking my car. Then I had to erase all the patterns and redraw them. But at the same time, he is also lucky. I found that my first pass seemed to be a little too dark, so this gave me a chance to correct that.

<p class="one">Last Friday was my mom's birthday. I took my friend's pet dog to my house and spent a happy day with my mom. I thought my friend's pet dog would be happy too. After all, my mom walked the dog at least six times that day. But the strange thing is that although my mother likes dogs very much, she will never get a dog of her own. Maybe it’s because I’m already considered a pet at home, and having me as a pet is enough. </p>
